In this first assignment we will practice forking, cloning, branching, committing, merging, pushing and pull requesting. You will perform this workflow for each chapter throughout this class so it will be really important to have a solid understanding of this process. This assignment is by itself in it's own repository because the instructor will be trying to merge your pull request into a single file.

<h3>Jedi Tasks</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Intro_Github_VCS.py</b> - You will be assigned 10 lines of code in the Intro_Github_VCS.py file in this repository to practice the VCS workflow. You will be completed with this Jedi Task when your instructor can respond to your pull request without any merging conflicts.</li>


  </ol>
