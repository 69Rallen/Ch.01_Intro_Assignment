In this chapter you will be practicing forking, cloning, branching, committing, merging, pushing and pull requesting. With the exception of pull requesting you will perform this workflow for each chapter throughout this class so it will be really important to have a solid understanding of this process. 

<h3>Jedi Task</h3>

<h3>Jedi Tasks</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Github_VCS.py - You will be assigned 10 lines of code in the Github_VCS.py file in this repository to practice the VCS workflow. You will be completed with this Jedi Task when your instructor can respond to your pull request without any merging conflicts.</li>
  <li>Take Home Test - Take Home tests are not pull-requested. They are pushed to your Github account, where you get the link and submit using the form at the end of each chapter.</li>
  </ol>
