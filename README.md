In this first assignment we will practice forking, cloning, branching, committing, merging, pushing and pull requesting. You will perform this workflow for each chapter throughout this class so it will be really important to have a solid understanding of this process. This assignment is by itself in it's own repository because the instructor will be trying to merge your pull request into a single file.
